🇹🇷 Analyze-Turkey
📝 What's This All About?
Welcome to the Analyze-Turkey project! This is a really cool data science project that lets you explore and understand Turkey's socio-economic data. We've used data from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TÜİK) to create a bunch of Jupyter notebooks and a web interface. The best part? Everything runs right on your computer, so your data is always private and safe!

🚀 What Can It Do?
Deep Analysis: Dive into different aspects of Turkish society, including education, poverty, and demographics, using detailed data analysis.

Jupyter Notebooks: We've got notebooks for various analyses, so you can see exactly how we've worked with the data.

Local Database: All the cleaned and processed data is stored in a local SQL database on your machine.

Web Interface: An interactive web page lets you see the dataframes from your local database with visualizations and filtering options.

Data Privacy: Everything is kept on your own computer, so you're in full control of your data.

⚙️ What's Under the Hood?
This project uses a mix of Python for data science and web development.

Python: The core language for all the data analysis and backend logic.

Jupyter: For running all the detailed analysis notebooks.

Pandas: The main tool for data manipulation and cleaning.

SQL: To create and manage the local database.

Flask: A lightweight web framework for the web interface.

HTML & CSS: For the web pages that let you interact with the data.

🛠️ How to Get Started
To get this running, you'll need to set up your Python environment and a few dependencies.

Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/kutluhaan/Analyze-Turkey.git
cd Analyze-Turkey

Install the dependencies:
You'll need a few libraries for Python.

pip install pandas numpy flask

Run the notebooks:
You can open and run the Jupyter Notebooks to see the data analysis process.

Run the web app:
To see the web interface, you'll need to run the Flask app.

cd "Analyze Turkey/Web_Page"
python page_control.py

This will start a local server, and you can access the web page in your browser to see the data.

🙏 A Big Thank You!
